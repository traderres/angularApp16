/*
	Developer notes:
	- This class contains all the nav items for the entire app - this is the only place you should be adding nav items.
	- When copying items, be sure to include the maps - they are there to automatically set values to their defaults.
	- Changes made to this file will impact BOTH the collapsed and extended navbar components - test BOTH of them!
	- When adding nav-items, you should not need to touch any HTML
	- TWO NAV ELEMENTS SHOULD NEVER SHARE A URL/ADDRESS!! (this will break the selection highlighting functions)

	Remember:
	- Copying is easier/safer when things are collapsed
